# Symbol-Detection-for-Ultra-Massive-MIMO-Systems
MSc. Detection and Estimation Coursework Project

Signal detection is one of the significant issues in uplink massive MIMO (multiple input multiple 
output) systems due to the deployment of a large number of antennas. In this project, 
 The modelling and comparative investigation of various detection algorithms in massive MIMO 
systems is done to achieve the optimal error rate performance with low complexity. 
 The simulation-based comparison is conducted between equalization-based linear detectors, 
approximate matrix inversion-based linear detectors, and non-linear BOX equalization detectors.
 The error rate performance is evaluated with different MIMO scenarios in terms of different 
ratios between the  number of users and base station (BS) antennas (β), and different numbers of 
iterations (n)
